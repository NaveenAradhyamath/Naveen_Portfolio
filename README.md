# Project1: [Student Score Predictor using R: Overview:](https://github.com/NaveenAradhyamath/findme_Naveen/blob/main/student_score_predlm.Rmd)

# Title: 
Predicting the percentage of an student based on the number of study hours using linear regression model.

# Description:

## 1.Purpose of the project:
As a part the of sparks foundation internship, i have completed this task. Its main objective is to predict the score of an student based on study hours using linear regression model.

## 2.Skills used by me to complete this project:
I have used R language for the analysis. And I have done data cleaning and data manipulation and performed EDA. finally i have used linear regression model.

## 3.The final result of the project:
I have identified that there is 97.5% probability that the true unknown value of the coefficient will fall within the specified range. Therefore i was successful in predicting the score of an student studying for 9.25 hours.

## Code and Resources used:
R Studio

packages : readr, dplyr, ggplot2

# Project2: [EDA of Superstore: Overview](https://github.com/NaveenAradhyamath/Naveen_Portfolio/blob/main/EDA_SuperStore.ipynb)

# Title:
To identify the weak areas where I can work to make more profit of the Superstore by performing EDA.

## 1.Purpose of the project:
To identify the weak areas of the superstore and to increase the business profit and thereby reducing the losses.

## 2.Skills used by me to complete this project:
I have used Python programming and performed EDA.

## 3.The final result of the project:
1.As we know that there is a negative correlation between the profit and discount.

2.Maximum Discounts are given to 'Office Supply Category' and the distribution or the sales of this category in the dataset is high and hence there is a Loss.

## Code and Resources used:
Anaconda Jupyter Notebook

Python Programming.

packages : pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

# Project 3: [predict the future revenues, expenses and gross profits of a company: Overview](https://github.com/NaveenAradhyamath/findme_Naveen/blob/main/SENSEX_Price_Prediction.ipynb)

# Title:
To predict the future revenues, expenses and gross profits of a company using Monte Carlo simulation.

## 1.Purpose of the project:
To Identify the future business profits and losses by using past data of a company so that we understand the future problems and consequences thereby to take some actions.

## 2.Skills used by me to complete this project:
I have used Python programming and Monte-Carlo Simulation.

## 3.The final result of the project:
I was able to predict the different series of outcomes and the maximum distribution of the values fall between the range 140-150 and hence i have found out the mean that is 144 and i can conclude that the predicted value of gross profit is 144 million dollars.

## Code and Resources used:
Anaconda Jupyter Notebook

Python Programming.

packages : pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scipy

# Project 4: [Future prices of SENSEX Stock:](https://github.com/NaveenAradhyamath/findme_Naveen/blob/main/SENSEX_Price_Prediction.ipynb)

# Title:
A hybrid model to predict the SENSEX stock price/performance using Monte Carlo Simulation:

## 1.Purpose of the project:
To predict the future 1000 days values of the SENSEX stock and to know how the market is going to be volatile over a period of time.

## 2.Skills used by me to complete this project:
I have used Python programming and Monte-Carlo Simulation.

## 3.The final result of the project:
I was able to predict the different series of outcomes and the SENSEX value performance for upcoming 1000 days and hence i would like to say that this model is useful for the future prediction of values.

## Code and Resources used:
Anaconda Jupyter Notebook

Python Programming.

packages: pandas, numpy, matplotlib
