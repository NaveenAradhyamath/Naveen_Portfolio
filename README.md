# Project1: [Student Score Predictor using R: Overview:](https://github.com/NaveenAradhyamath/findme_Naveen/blob/main/student_score_predlm.Rmd)

# Title: 
Predicting the percentage of an student based on the number of study hours using linear regression model.

# Description:

# 1.Purpose of the project:

As a part the of sparks foundation internship, i have completed this task. Its main objective is to predict the score of an student based on study hours using linear regression model.

# 2.Skills used by me to complete this project:

I have used R language for the analysis. And I have done data cleaning and data manipulation and performed EDA. finally i have used linear regression model.

# 3.The final result of the project:

I have identified that there is 97.5% probability that the true unknown value of the coefficient will fall within the specified range. Therefore i was successful in predicting the score of an student studying for 9.25 hours.

# Code and Resources used:
R Studio

packages : readr, dplyr, ggplot2

# Project2: [EDA of Superstore: Overview](https://github.com/NaveenAradhyamath/Naveen_Portfolio/blob/main/EDA_SuperStore.ipynb)

# Title:
To identify the weak areas where I can work to make more profit of the Superstore by performing EDA.

# 1.Purpose of the project:

To identify the weak areas of the superstore and to increase the business profit and thereby reducing the losses.

# 2.Skills used by me to complete this project:

I have used Python programming and performed EDA.

# 3.The final result of the project:
1.As we know that there is a negative correlation between the profit and discount.

2.Maximum Discounts are given to 'Office Supply Category' and the distribution or the sales of this category in the dataset is high and hence there is a Loss.
