# Title: [Student Score Predictor using R: Overview:](https://github.com/NaveenAradhyamath/findme_Naveen/blob/main/student_score_predlm.Rmd)
Predicting the percentage of an student based on the number of study hours using linear regression model.

# Description:

# 1.Purpose of the project:

As a part the of sparks foundation internship, i have completed this task. Its main objective is to predict the score of an student based on study hours using linear regression model.

# 2.Skills used by me to complete this project:

I have used R language for the analysis. And I have done data cleaning and data manipulation and performed EDA. finally i have used linear regression model.

# 3.The final result of the project:

I have identified that there is 97.5% probability that the true unknown value of the coefficient will fall within the specified range. Therefore i was successful in predicting the score of an student studying for 9.25 hours.
